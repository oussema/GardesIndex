Why Gardes Index ?


The idea come from the Stock Market Indexes, S&P 500 groups 500 companies.
So when you invest your money in S&P 500 for example, you are putting your money hoping that S&P 500 Indexe go up.
By investing in such Market you are dividing your investing risk over 500 shares (companies).
So Gardes Index work the same way like Stock Market Indexes, It gives you information about a some of crypto 
currencies how they are doing. For example Gardes Index 20, groups the first 20 Crypto currencies by Market Caps,
so if you invest in the first 20 Cryptos by bying the same amount of each one, the Gardes Index 20 will tell how much
you are gaining profit if Gardes Index 20 is going up, and how much you loose if Gardes Index 20 is going down.
